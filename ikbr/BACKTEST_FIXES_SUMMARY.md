# Backtest System Fixes Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Duplicate Tick Events
**Problem**: The backtest engine was emitting tick events twice:
- Once via MockIB's `pendingTickersEvent` → MarketDataManager → TICK event
- Once directly from the backtest engine

**Fix**: Removed the direct tick event emission from the backtest engine (line 361-365 in `backtest/engine.py`). Now tick events are only emitted through the MarketDataManager when MockIB's prices are updated.

### 2. Missing Position Exits
**Problem**: Positions were not being closed properly due to:
- Multiple exit signals being generated for the same position
- Risk manager blocking some exit orders due to order frequency limits

**Fixes**:
- Added check in `_check_positions` to avoid multiple close orders for the same position
- Added tracking of processed orders to avoid handling duplicate order filled events
- Store entry price in order metadata for proper exit calculations

### 3. Division by Zero Errors
**Problem**: BacktestResult calculations failed for same-day backtests when calculating annualized returns.

**Fix**: Added check for days > 0 before calculating annualized returns. For same-day backtests, use rough annualization.

### 4. Duplicate Order Processing
**Problem**: Order filled events were being processed multiple times by strategies.

**Fix**: Added `_processed_orders` set to track already processed order IDs and ignore duplicates.

## Remaining Issues

### Multiple Event Processing
While we've mitigated the effects, there's still some duplication in event processing that causes:
- Position exit to be triggered multiple times (though only one close order succeeds)
- Some orders being rejected by risk manager due to order frequency limits

This appears to be due to the asynchronous nature of event processing and could be further optimized by:
1. Ensuring tick events are deduplicated at the source
2. Adding more sophisticated state management for position transitions
3. Implementing event batching for high-frequency tick data

## Code Changes Made

1. **backtest/engine.py**:
   - Removed duplicate tick event emission
   - Fixed division by zero in annualized return calculation
   - Added handling for sells without positions

2. **strategies/base_strategy.py**:
   - Added `_processed_orders` tracking
   - Added check for pending close orders before triggering new ones
   - Store entry price in order metadata
   - Improved logging for debugging

## Testing Results

After fixes:
- ✅ Positions are being closed (SELL orders executed)
- ✅ No duplicate trades in final results
- ✅ Backtest completes without errors
- ✅ P&L calculations work correctly

The enhanced momentum strategy now works properly in backtesting with both entry and exit signals being executed.
